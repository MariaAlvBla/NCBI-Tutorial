# Sharing data that has already been uploaded to NCBI

Whenever data has been submitted, NCBI creates a summary table of the attribute and metadata information of all the genetic information included in a BioProject. The problem with this table is that many of the fields don't need to follow a consistent format in order to be submitted to NCBI. For example, the word amplicon can be written as *amplicon*, *Amplicon* or *AMPLICON*. This can signify a problem when wanting to combine the summary data of several projects in which the authors wrote the values differently. It hinders the large scale analysis of genetic data.

For the Datathon we have created a customed table that includes the BioSample attributes and SRA metadata that will facilitate the gathering of genetic information from different regions with an homogenized format. This tutorial will guide you on how to transform the table given by NCBI from already submitted data to the homogenized format created for the purpose of the Datathon.

When people finish a submission you can download an excel that includes metadata and attribute information. We want the people that already uploaded data to copy and paste their information to our own version of the merged excel file that will also have the drop-down menus from the other excel files.
Just tell them:
1.	We want them to give us the accession numbers of the runs (srr) and the PRJ number
2.	I need to make a new excel data, use the one sent from Stephanie (NCBI).

*Drop down menus must still work (the spelling should all be the same to make sure the coding works). The metadata
