# NCBI-Tutorial
Submitting data to the Portal of the National Library of Medicine (NCBI) may seem daunting for first-time users or even researchers who have already submitted some data. Unfortunately, the instructions for submitting are scattered on different “helping guides” on the website, and every time you want to submit data, you must navigate several of those guides to any questions you may have. For example, these problems occur when submitting S16 rRNA data. This might have dissuaded many scientists from using NCBI’s Portal to deposit their sequences and, therefore, hindered the sharing of data for regional or large-scale analysis. As part of the “Datatón: un evento dedicado al archivado y reanálisis de datos de microbiota,” the authors have created this instructive to compile and summarize the “help information” written in NCBI’s portal more comprehensively and provide a step-to-step guide on how to carry essential tasks in NCBI. We have focused this instructive on the deposition of S16 rRNA’s sequences due to the nature of the Datatón, but many of the explained steps apply to other kinds of genetic data. We hope this instructive will forward the collaboration efforts of microbiome researchers and that it will help any young researchers interested in the field.
