## Registering to NCBI <a name="registering"></a>
To register to NCBI follow the next process:

- [**Access NCBI's homepage**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and select ***Log in***.

## Accessing the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) <a name="accessingsra"></a>

For accessing the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) follow the next steps:

- While being logged in, [**Access NCBI's homepage**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). ***write 16S rRNA*** 

- Select ***Submit***.


<img src="C:\Users\chepi\Desktop\IDIV job\MiCoDa\Educational material\pictures for github\home-submit.png" style="width:6.3in;height:1.13861in" />

 
- The main page of the Submission Portal will be displayed. For the occasion of the Datathon, ***write 16S rRNA*** in the search bar and ***select SRA***. This leads to the Sequence Read Archive, which specializing in managing data such 16S rRNA.

-  A webpage with information on the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) will be displayed. Select ***Submit***.

## Submitting data to SRA Submission Wizard] <a name="submittingwizard"></a>

### Aspects to consider before submitting data <a name="aspects"></a>
- If human data comes from a metagenomic study, donor consent is necessary.

- Each upload must be kept under 5 TB, if you have more, split the upload across multiple submissions.

- Submissions can be linked to the same BioProject to ensure all data are searchable with a single accession code.

- Every fastq file should be less than 100 GB in size. If compressed files are larger than 100 GB, please split them before submission.

### Steps necessary to submit data <a name="steps"></a>
For every step, you will have to add information or files; whenever you want to save your progress, you must press ***Continue***. You can review or make changes to your previous steps during submission by clicking on the preceding tabs.  

At any point, after having saved your progress, you can leave NCBI and continue the process of submission later. Accessing an unfinished submission will be explained in the section [***Accessing an unfinished submission***](#unfinished). If, however, you click the ***Submit*** button at the last step, making changes would follow other routes; which is explained in the section [***Changing a submission***](#changing). 

You may get *Error* or *Warning* messages when saving your progress. Error messages describe the Error and suggest a solution that must be corrected before you can move to the next step of your submission. On the other hand, the Warning messages attempt to prevent you from making a possible mistake and do not block you from continuing your submission.
