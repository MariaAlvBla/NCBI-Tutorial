#Sharing data that has already been uploaded to NCBI

For the Datathon we have created customed BioSample attributes and SRA metadata tables that
will facilitate the gathering of genetic information from different regions with an homogenized
format. This tutorial will guide you on how to transform the tables given by NCBI from already
submitted data to the homogenized format created for the purpose of the Datathon.

When people finish a submission you can download an excel that includes metadata and attribute information. We want the people that already uploaded data to copy and paste their information to our own version of the merged excel file that will also have the drop-down menus from the other excel files.
Just tell them:
1.	We want them to give us the accession numbers of the runs (srr) and the PRJ number
2.	I need to make a new excel data, use the one sent from Stephanie (NCBI).

*Drop down menus must still work (the spelling should all be the same to make sure the coding works). The metadata
